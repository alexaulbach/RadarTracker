0.3.0 2016-10-31
- Stabilized, immoveables and movement tracker now works reliable.
- Debug-mode. I think the idea of the "debugger" is cool. It helped me a lot to find the bugs, to see, when an entity changed state.

- Introduced tracker types. Types are: trains (locos or wagons), stops (all train stops), cars (cars, tanks, satellite-uplink...); currently still only trains works.
- Rewrote initialization. on a very large map (8 GiB) with >300 trains initialisation takes only 20 seconds vs. hours from before.
- Avoid double reinitialization.
- Re-increased scan rate cause I want to reduce average number of scans per train. Also looks much better.
