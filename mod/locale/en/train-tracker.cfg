[entity-description]
movement-tracker    = Keeps track of any train and vehicle: If stopped it is tracked every 17.5 seconds. In movement every 0.5 seconds. Cars become a longer reach in driving direction.
immoveables-tracker = Keeps track of train-stops and roboports every 30 seconds.
rotational-tracker  = (not working yet!) Charts occupied chunks every minute. "Occupied" means: There are 3 or more entities of the same force in that chunk.
change-tracker      = (not working yet!) Charts any build and destruction (robots, that build blueprints, natives that destroy things).
